## Projects
### HD maps dynamic and long-term updating methods and interaction mechanism @ [TJU](https://umi.tongji.edu.cn/en/Homepage.htm)(_Nov 2021-present_)

- The National Key R&D Program of China leading by [Prof. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/)

Based the High-Definition map model proposed in this project, my research on studying the main contents of dynamic information of HD map and its **exchange format**, and propose information **interaction approaches** applicable to the interaction between vehicle and cloud data terminals.



### Solving vehicle routing problems based on deep reinforcement learning @[NJAU](https://english.njau.edu.cn/)(_Sep 2020-May 2021_)

- Undergraduate Thesis Research Plan advised by Assoc. Prof. Yang Liu

Based on existing trained **deep learning** model to solve the route planning problem of how to plan delivery path points for vehicles with capacity constraints to find the approximate optimal solution for the shortest route.
