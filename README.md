## Projects
### HD Maps Dynamic and Long-term Updating Methods and Interaction Mechanism@[TJU](https://umi.tongji.edu.cn/en/Homepage.htm)(_Nov 2021-present_)

 The National Key R&D Program of China Leading by [Prof. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/)

In this project, we propose a **High-Definition Map** (HD Map) model, focusing on the dynamic information of HD map and its exchange format. We design a comprehensive content structure and data exchange format for the dynamic information of HD map and develop a [Group Standard](https://www.csgpc.org/detail/23300.html). Additionally, we propose an information interaction approach to be used between autonomous vehicles and high definition map for broadcasting and receiving dynamic information. The [The phased research result](http://ch.whu.edu.cn/en/article/doi/10.13203/j.whugis20230166) has already been published in the Journal of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

### Solving Vehicle Routing Problems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning@[NJAU](https://english.njau.edu.cn/)(_Sep 2020-May 2021_)

Undergraduate Thesis Research Plan Advised by [Assoc. Prof. Yang Liu](https://ai.njau.edu.cn/info/1062/1179.htm)

We utilized a trained deep learning model to address the **Route Planning** problem, specifically focusing on how to efficiently plan delivery paths for vehicles with capacity constraints. Our enhanced algorithm is applied to vehicle path planning scenarios with 20, 50, and 100 nodes, respectively. The result indicates that trucks tend to prioritize nodes that are farther from the warehouse during the middle stages of the journey. Aside from the final route, which must cover the remaining nodes, the algorithm ensures that each route maximizes the number of visited nodes.
